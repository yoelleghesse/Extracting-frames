This script takes a video file (video.mp4) as input and prompts the user to enter a timestamp in the format hh:mm:ss. It then extracts the frame from the video corresponding to the entered timestamp and saves it as an image file in the JPEG format.

Install OpenCV:

``pip install opencv-python``

Place the video file (video.mp4) you want to extract frames from in the project folder.

Run the script:

``python video_frame_extractor.py``

Enter the desired timestamp when prompted in the hh:mm:ss format.

The script will extract the frame from the video at the specified timestamp and save it as an image file in the project folder.
